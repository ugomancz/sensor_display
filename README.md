# Display of physical quantities
This repository contains my bachelor's thesis, which I worked on during my studies at FI MUNI in the academic year 2021/2022.

## Abstract
This thesis aimed to analyze the possibilities of information transmission between the display device and the sensor and summarize the possibilities of information transmission used in embedded devices in general. Furthermore, this thesis aimed to design and implement a device based on the MSP432E411Y-BGAEVM microcontroller to read and display data from the MDG-04 sensor using a serial line and the ModBus-RTU protocol.

The results of this thesis are an overview chapter describing the possibilities of information transmission and a functional prototype of the display device.
