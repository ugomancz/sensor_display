# Display of physical quantities
This repository contains my bachelor's thesis, which I worked on during my studies at FI MUNI in the academic year 2021/2022.

## Goal of this thesis
This thesis consists of a written document and a source code for a prototype device.
- The document summarizes different methods of connecting microcontrollers and peripherals such as RS-485, Ethernet, CAN, and communication protocols used on top of these connections.
- Source code was written to create a working prototype using Texas Instrument's MSP432E4 microcontroller and VF MDG-04 gamma-ray sensor. The microcontroller uses Modbus-RTU to communicate and display the sensor readings on an LCD panel.
